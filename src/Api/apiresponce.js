      about: `As a dedicated web developer with a strong passion for coding, I have spent the last two years developing expertise in front-end, back-end, and database management. Currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science Engineering, I have honed my skills across multiple programming languages and frameworks, including C++, JavaScript, React, and Git. Rather than confining myself to a specific "stack," I embrace the concept of a "non-stack" developer, focusing on mastering the art of development across various domains.Inspired by the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, I believe in the philosophy of focusing on the work itself rather than the results. For me, coding is not just a professionâ€”it's a passion. From building high-performance portfolios to developing chat applications with APIs like Gemini, I am constantly pushing my boundaries, seeking out new challenges to improve and evolve.I am also a strong advocate of "learning in public," regularly sharing my insights and resources to contribute to the broader IT community. My ultimate goal is to make a meaningful contribution to the industry and have a positive impact on society.`,
